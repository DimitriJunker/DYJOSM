## This Version

23.Jul.2016

This version of Bbox-tool is a downgraded version of the original.
Mainly I reduced the output-formats to one and changed some text.
The Copyright is of course still the one of Norbert Renner, whom I like to thank herewith.
On July 11 2016 some Mapquest services were discontinued. Lukily Norbert had alrady a solution, see:
